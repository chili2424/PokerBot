NOTE:
REMEMBER, WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GOING OFF AND CODING EVERYTHING ON OUR OWN. Any changes must
not be attempts to write entire sections of the code individually. This is not what a team project
is about. We will write almost all of the code TOGETHER. Github is a tool for us to use to think and look
at the code without having all the code on my laptop. It is not a tool for one of us to go ahead and write
large portions of the code ourselves, but instead only do minor changes/edits.


HOW TO EDIT:
Any changes that are made MUST be commented so that other users see what you did.
You must include the date/time/author of the change and a simple description of the change.
